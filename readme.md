## The Business Problem
**Context:** A retail company sends promotional emails to all customers. However, mass marketing is inefficient:
* It wastes money on **"Sure Things"** (customers who would buy anyway).
* It annoys **"Sleeping Dogs"** (customers who react negatively to ads).
* It ignores the **"Persuadables"** (the only group that truly adds incremental value).

**Goal:** Build an Uplift Model to target *only* the Persuadables, thereby maximizing **Incremental ROI**.

##  Business Impact (The "Money Slide")
Using a **T-Learner Causal Model** on a blind test set of 8,500 customers, I simulated two strategies. The Uplift strategy significantly outperformed the baseline.

| Strategy | Target Audience | Revenue | Cost | **Profit (ROI)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Mass Marketing** | 100% (Everyone) | $10,995 | $8,520 | $2,475 |
| **Uplift Model** | Top 20% (Persuadables) | $9,868 | $1,704 | **$8,164** |
| **Impact** | | | | **+230% Increase** 🚀 |

> **Key Insight:** By emailing 80% *fewer* people, we nearly *tripled* the profit.

##  Methodology & Tech Stack

### The Approach: The "Four Quadrants"
I used Causal Inference to categorize customers based on their **Conditional Average Treatment Effect (CATE)**:

* 🟩 **Persuadables:** Buy only if treated. *(High Uplift)* -> **Target**
* ⬜ **Sure Things:** Buy regardless. *(Zero Uplift)* -> **Ignore**
* ⬜ **Lost Causes:** Never buy. *(Zero Uplift)* -> **Ignore**
* 🟥 **Sleeping Dogs:** Churn if treated. *(Negative Uplift)* -> **Avoid**

### Tech Stack
* **Python:** Pandas, NumPy
* **Machine Learning:** Scikit-Learn (Random Forest Classifiers)
* **Causal Method:** T-Learner (Meta-Learner)
* **Evaluation:** Qini Curve, Decile Analysis

## 📊 Visualizing Success
*The chart demonstrates the model's ability to segregate high-lift customers (Decile 9) from negative-lift customers (Decile 0).*
